# Network Types
- Wide Area Network (WAN)	Internet
- Local Area Network (LAN)	Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)	Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)	Connects multiple network sites to one LAN
- GAN - A worldwide network such as the Internet is known as a Global Area Network (GAN). However, the Internet is not the only computer network of this kind. Internationally active companies also maintain isolated networks that span several WANs and connect company computers worldwide. GANs use the glass fibers infrastructure of wide-area networks and interconnect them by international undersea cables or satellite transmission.

- PAN / WPAN - Modern end devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers can be connected ad hoc to form a network to enable data exchange. This can be done by cable in the form of a Personal Area Network (PAN).The wireless variant Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) is based on Bluetooth or Wireless USB technologies. A wireless personal area network that is established via Bluetooth is called Piconet. PANs and WPANs usually extend only a few meters and are therefore not suitable for connecting devices in separate rooms or even buildings.In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), WPANs are used to communicate control and monitor applications with low data rates. Protocols such as Insteon, Z-Wave, and ZigBee were explicitly designed for smart homes and home automation.

# Proxies
- Security Professionals jump to HTTP Proxies (BurpSuite) or pivoting with a SOCKS/SSH Proxy (Chisel, ptunnel, sshuttle).

- Web Developers use proxies like Cloudflare or ModSecurity to block malicious traffic.

- Average people may think a proxy is used to obfuscate your location and access another country's Netflix catalog.

- Law Enforcement often attributes proxies to illegal activity.

Not all the above examples are correct. A proxy is when a device or service sits in the middle of a connection and acts as a mediator. The mediator is the critical piece of information because it means the device in the middle must be able to inspect the contents of the traffic. Without the ability to be a mediator, the device is technically a gateway, not a proxy.

# Networking Key Terminology
There are many different terms in the field of information technology. However, we only need to know some of them, only the essential ones. Information technology has become so big that it equals the medical sector, if not already surpasses it. The number of programming languages, functions, protocols, different procedures, areas of application, details, and at the same time, the number of errors that can occur. All these areas are so large that you can specialize your entire career in 1-2 areas.

The key terminology is the rough alphabet we need to know to understand what we will talk about in the other modules. We have created a list with many different but still with the most common protocols and their descriptions to create this foundation. It is important to note that this list is incomplete, and we will cover one or two protocols in other modules. However, we recommend that you review this list from time to time and expand it as you learn new protocols.
